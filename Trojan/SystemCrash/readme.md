# System Crash
It just crashes the OS and does nothing else.
<br>It looks like a joke software, but it is a Trojan :)
<br>
<br>
## How Crash
First edition: Kill svchost.exe
<br>Version 2: NtRaiseHardError (Created in C++)
<br>Version 3: \\.\globalroot\device\condrv\kernelconnect (does not currently work)
<br>(Version 2 requires runtime)
