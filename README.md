# Malware Database
This is Yuuya's Malware Database.
<br>It mainly distributes self-made malware and may add more in the future.
<br>Also, be aware that running this malware on someone else's computer without permission can be criminal.
<br>Most of it here is unzipped. This is also to save the trouble of unzipping.
<br>I am not responsible for any damage caused by running these malware. __At your own risk!__
<br>The best way is [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) or [VMware Workstation](https://www.vmware.com/jp/products/workstation-pro/workstation-pro-evaluation.html) in a virtual machine.

<br>__WARNING:__ DO NOT TRY THIS ON A REAL MACHINE! YOUR COMPUTER WILL NO LONGER BOOT!

## FAQ
### My malware is being uploaded without permission.
I'm sorry! We are careful not to distribute malware that is "distribution prohibited" here, but if you find prohibited distribution malware, please contact us at the email address below.

### Why no ransomware here?
Here's a lot of what I keep on my PC.
<br>I don't have ransomware stored on my PC, so it's not here.
<br>Also, there is no "false warning" due to the number of folders.

### Malware doesn't work. What should I do?
First, try to download properly again. If it still doesn't work please send us an email.

### I want you to upload my malware.
Yes, please use file sharing to send me malware. You don't need to use methods like Google Drive that block malware distribution.
<br>A GitHub repository is also fine. Send us a link with the full URL of the repository that contains the malware. (Example: `https://github.com/Name/Malware/Trojan/Trojan.Win32.Virus.zip`)
<br>Please send that link somewhere. You don't need to send it in places like YouTube comments where it will be "deleted".
In my case, Discord DM is recommended.
